On </span><i><span>Mind Your Manners</span></i><span>, this etiquette coach “brings out the best in people” and takes contestants on a “journey of self-discovery.”</span></p><p><span>But who’s Sara’s husband? What’s her net worth? Learn all about her as this article proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Sara Jane Ho On Netflix’s Mind Your Manners</b></h3><p><span>Sara Jane Ho has been teaching people correct manners all over the world, and luckily for us, it’s now featured on the Netflix series, </span><i><span>Mind Your Manners</span></i><span>. The show was announced to release on November 16, 2022, as the trailer saw Sara teaching her students how to cut a banana correctly, hold themselves, horse ride, and even provide tips on dressing well.</span></p><p><span>“International etiquette teacher Sara Jane Ho helps people become their best selves through good manners in this heartwarming makeover series,” </span><i><span>Mind Your Manners</span></i><span>’ official description read.</span></p><p><span>Excited to share her work, Sara took it to her IG to promote the show and urged her fans to join her 6 episode journey with her students who signed up for etiquette lessons. “Get ready to laugh and cry with us as they blossom into their best selves. Save the show to your My List now,” she added.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about her students, she said that every class and every student was different. But her method remained the same — to help “students find the wisdom and strength within themselves” through correct etiquette.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Sara Jane Ho Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Sara Jane flaunted a net worth of over $2.5 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>A global etiquette coach, Sara is a passionate entrepreneur and the founder of </span><i><span>Institute Sarita</span></i><span> — China’s first etiquette school. It was also named one of the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.</span></p><p><span>Her school helps Chinese women learn to navigate cross-cultural intricacies. But Sara also speaks out for those less privileged, raising awareness about autism and women’s issues, including the problem of domestic violence in China.</span></p><p><span>So, what makes Sara so special? Well, she combines her knowledge and insights from Harvard Business School, Swiss finishing school, and her experience, to deliver a rich and complete curriculum.</span></p><p><i><span>Institute Sarita</span></i><span> is now also grouped under </span><i><span>Miss Wonder Omnimedia</span></i><span>, a company Sara launched in 2022,</span></p><p><i><span>Miss Wonder </span></i><span>is an online store of curated beauty, wellness, and quality living for her Chinese students and followers. Her products including home decor, skincare, fragrance, haircare, jewelry, and more made an average of $150 per customer.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to her contributions, the etiquette coach was also named to Forbes’ Women to Watch in Asia in 2013 and BBC’s 100 Women in 2015.</span></p><p><span>As for those aspiring to be like her, she asked them to have a humble eagerness to learn something from everybody. If you do so, your learning opportunities “will be unlimited,” she added.</span></p><h3><b>Sara Jane Ho Husband</b></h3><p><span>Sara Jane Ho didn’t talk about her husband. But she didn’t mind opening up about her past dating life.</span></p><p><span>Recalling her first date with her boyfriend, she said he was waiting outside the restaurant for her, taking a long last drag of his cigarette before putting it out. “It was just electric,” she remarked.</span></p><p><span>Also, after dating for just 2 weeks, Sara then flew to Hong Kong and surprised her boyfriend on his doorstep! “We FaceTimed and I pointed my camera at his front door. I’m aloof in relationships so this was a first for me,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>As for her funniest dating memory, it was watching her date eat an oyster with his butter knife.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Sara’s a godmother. She has a godson and a daughter.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Sara Jane Ho?</b></h3><p><span>Sara Jane Ho was born on December 5, 1986. That made her 35 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>This means she was 28 when she founded </span><i><span>Institute Sarita</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>As per her birthday, Sara is of the Sagittarius zodiac.</span></p><h3><b>Sara Jane Ho Family</b></h3><p><span>Sara Jane Ho was inspired by her <a href=#>family</a>; especially her mother whom she saw create magic moments and gave people a sense of belonging through entertainment. Sadly, she passed away when Sara was 21. Now, Sara continues her legacy by combining her passion for social entertainment with a need in China for etiquette.</span></p><p><span>As for Sara’s dad, he was alive and doing well as of 2022. According to the star, her dad always knew she would become an etiquette teacher. He is the kindest soul she knows. No wonder, he built hospitals in China, then donated them to the municipal government.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, we don’t know much about Sara’s siblings.</span></p><p><span>Other members of Sara’s family include her uncle Alan (who designed the Coca-Cola logo for China), aunt Adrianne Ho (Founder of </span><i><span>Sweat The Style</span></i><span>), and her beloved grandmother who often graced Sara’s IG.</span></p><p><span>It seems Sara’s granny in her younger days was street-smart, and even rode a bike, despite being a mother of two. She was adventurous — the cool grandma all of us wish for.</span></p><h3><b>Sara Jane Ho Height</b></h3><p><span>Sara Jane Ho stands tall at a height above 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Sara Jane Ho From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Sara hails from Hong Kong.</span></p><p><span>But as of 2022, she resided in Shanghai, China.</span></p><p><span>Surprisingly, she can speak English, Cantonese, Mandarin, German, and French</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>Is Sara Jane Ho On Instagram And Facebook?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Find her on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>sarajaneho</span></a><span> and Facebook @</span><a href=#><span>sarajaneho</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, here’s her Twitter @</span><a href=#><span>sarajaneho</span></a><span>, TikTok @</span><a href=#><span>sarajaneho</span></a><span>, and Youtube @</span><a href=#><span>Sara Jane Ho</span></a><span>.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>What Is Sara Jane Ho Book Called?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Sara penned the best-selling etiquette book in China called “Finishing Touch: Good Manners for the Debutante.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmrJmilnqrrc2eZKGnXZ3CtK7Ap5tmppWperi70a2fZqWZo7Fuxc6uqWalkaO7pr7SaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./next-level-chef-season-2-cast-photos.html>&#171;&nbsp;Photos Of Gordon Ramsays Show Hollywood Life</a>
