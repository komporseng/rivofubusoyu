So here we are to kill all of your curiosity and fill your appetite with a bucketload of information. Shall we get into it?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/amirah-781.jpg><p>But first, take a pill of quick facts that will help all along the journey.</p><h2>Amirah Dyme: Quick Facts</h2><table class=table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name</th><td>Amirah Dyme</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>1995 /01 /14</td></tr><tr><th>Nickname</th><td>Amirah</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status</th><td>Single</td></tr><tr><th>Birthplace</th><td>Germany</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>Mixed</td></tr><tr><th>Online Presence</th><td>Instagram, Twitter</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Actress, Model</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>German</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$2million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Wiki-Bio</h2><p>Amirah Dyme was born on 14th January 1995 in Germany. There is no detailed information about her parents available to the general media. Her secrecy has made us even harder to know anything in-depth. No detailed information is also available about any siblings.</p><p>Other than this, this Instagram diva belongs to mixed ethnicity and holds the German nationality. Likewise, her horoscope is Capricorn.</p><h2>Age, Weight, and Body Measurements</h2><p>Most of the readers here might be craving to know about her age and other vital body statistics. Well, do not worry, we have got it covered. Dyme was born in 1995, which makes her 25 years as of now. Likewise, Amirah recently celebrated her 25th birthday on the 14th of January, just weeks after the new year.</p><p>Moreover, Dyme stands at the height of 5’7″ and weighs around 70 kgs. Her curvaceous body can make any individual fall for her. In fact, it was her voluptuous body that got her fame in social media. Amirah is even nicknamed as ‘Cake Queen’ by her beloved fans and followers.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grace Elizabeth Age, Height, Model, Net Worth, Instagram, Wiki-Bio</a></h4><p>Sadly we have no idea about her vital body statistics but can say with ease that she has beautiful green eyes and blonde color hair. Her outlook and personality suit her in every possible way to steal out lots of boys’ hearts.</p><h2>Early Life, Education, and Ethnicity</h2><p>Amirah was born in Germany and spent most of her childhood there. Also, Amirah is the daughter of father, <strong>Kosar Dyme,</strong> and mother, <strong>Elsa Dyme</strong>. Some of the sources suggest that she has seven siblings, including a brother who appears on her Instagram videos regularly.</p><p>If sources are right, then it is sure that Amirah might have a bit hard childhood when she grew up. For her educational background, though, the young Dyme might have attended elementary school and higher school and graduated simultaneously.</p><p>Instead, it can also be vice-versa. Due to the protective nature, we can hardly give any confirmation about her educational background.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elena Moussa Biography – Age, Height, Career, Model, Net Worth, Husband</a></h4><p>Looking at the thick of thins, it is sure that Amirah is mainly well learned, and she has also carried herself well in the endorsements and promotional programs.</p><p>Likewise, the curvaceous diva, Amirah, is German by nationality and belongs to Sudanese ethnicity. As for her religion, Dyme follows Islam. It is because she was raised in a Sudanese Muslim family. Sadly, there is no further information on her childhood.</p><h2>Amirah Dyme: Plastic Surgery</h2><p>There is no doubt that Amirah has got one of the hottest and desirable bodies in the entertainment industry at the moment. It was also the reason why Dyme got so much attention in the media. Sadly, that’s the fact.</p><p>However, Amirah is proud of her voluptuous curve and even flaunts it every chance she gets. Just like Kim K, Dyme has got a substantial upper and lower body, retaining that tiny waist, giving Dyme the illusion of an hourglass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/amirah-0001.jpg><p>While many praise Amirah for her body and applauds her for maintaining it, many bashes her for setting an unrealistic body standard. Being a social influencer, numerous girls look up to her and dreams of having a body like her.</p><p>But since Dyme has been accused of going under the knife, many are worried that it might influence the girls to do the same.</p><h2>Amirah Dyme’s Career</h2><p>Amirah Dyme is one of the well known as of now. It was not the same case when she started her career. The modeling career began in 2016 when she began posting her images on the Instagram handle.</p><p>Slowly she started garnering good fans and also brand promotions and endorsements. Until now, Dyme has a good number of fans and also earned the nickname <strong>Cake Queen</strong>. There might not be any surety whether she will pursue her career as a model, but she is getting the right social media to reach for now.</p><p>Not only endorsements and modeling in the Instagram handle, but she is also actively involved in the peace against the war. This model belongs to Sudanese descent, so she has pleaded to work for peace in Sudan through her social media handles.</p><p>Surprisingly there is no confirmation whether she will become a professional model, but we tend to understand that she is willing to give back to society.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Modeling is a tough job to perform. It drains out an individual both emotionally and physically. Hence most of the models like to keep the information away from the prying eyes. Amirah is also very cautious not to share her love life with the media.</p><p>As of now, with no confirmation, she is single and focusing more on the career. There is no hint of being in a relationship as she is not sharing any images with any male friend on her social media handle. This model might be under some connection but has done outstanding in keeping it to herself.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Modeling is a fruitful job if done with high precision and interest. The net worth of this German-born model is estimated to be <strong>$2million</strong>. All of this amount is mainly from her modeling career, and this amount is drooling.</p><p>Moreover, it is reported that the model makes around<strong> $116,067</strong> yearly from her successful career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/amirah-782.jpeg><p>Not only social media modeling, but she also performs endorsements of brands like OH POLLY, FashionNova, PrettyLittle Thing, Oh Polly Swim, Blanco Bay, etc. This suggests the fact that she is living a lavish lifestyle with all of this earning.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Agnes Wilczynski Age, Career, Net Worth, Model, Husband, Married</a></h4><p>Woefully, we are not able to provide any idea about her houses, cars that she owns. Her privacy is hard to understand and pretty suspicious to some extent for some of the fans.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>– 2.9m followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>– 47.8k followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKagq5mYYrG6ucRmmKCdXZ2yqrPHrWScmaKasrN5waiwn6qZmrulec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bone-thugs-n-harmony-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bone Thugs-n-harmony Net Worth</a>
