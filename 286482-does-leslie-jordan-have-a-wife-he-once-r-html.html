He once remarked that the characters he plays are just exaggerated versions of himself. Usually, his characters are very out and proud of their gayness, flashy, and sassy.</p><p class=dh>Although Jordan is proud of his homosexuality now and has become known for retelling hilarious anecdotes from his life on Instagram, there was once a time in his youth that he hated himself for being gay.</p><p class=dh>The 66-year-old told Page Six that homophobia and self-loathing were instilled in him while growing up in a church-going Tennessee family in the 1950s.

During the pandemic, he became an Instagram phenomenon by sharing stories about growing up being different, starting his career in Los Angeles, and a few stories about his dating life.</p><p class=dh>Although he is currently single, he once admitted that like dated "straight boys" for many years and dated one for ten years. His partner was 20 years younger than him but was smitten for Jordan as the actor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/is-leslie-jordan-married>recalled</a>:</p><p class=dh>"It was an online thing for a long time.
