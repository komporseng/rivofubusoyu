Sadly, he and his fiancée Claudia Morales were waiting at a bus stop in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, when he was tragically stabbed.</strong></p><p>Claudia Morales, Ryan Carson’s girlfriend, was fatally stabbed.</p><p>The terrible tragedy that claimed the life of 32-year-old Ryan Carson, a social justice and climate change activist, shocked the people of Crown Heights, Brooklyn.</p><p>Ryan Carson and his fiancée Claudia Morales were horrified by an unwarranted and senseless attack that they observed at a bus stop on that tragic day.</p><p>Security footage that The Post has access to illuminates the horrifying events of that day.</p><p>It shows an attacker who wants information from the pair and has unclear intentions.</p><p><strong>“Just what are you looking at, exactly?”</strong></p><p>Tensions increased, so Carson tried to diffuse the situation by pleading with the man to calm down.</p><p>The attacker’s reaction to his first screaming was really horrifying.</p><p><strong>“I’ll murder you.”</strong></p><p>When the attacker pulled out a knife and repeatedly stabbed Ryan in the torso, things got out of hand. Claudia Morales was caught up in this terrifying experience when the unimaginable happened.</p><p>She gasped as she saw her companion, who had been attacked viciously and without warning, lying on the ground, bleeding profusely.</p><p>Apart from stabbing Claudia, the attacker also seemed to throw up in her face and hit Ryan while he was helpless and hurt.</p><p>In a last-ditch effort to save her son Ryan, Claudia called 911 right after the shocking attack. Sadly, even when first responders hurried to the scene, it was already too late.</p><p>The knife wound had pierced Ryan’s heart, and no matter how hard the medical staff tried, they were unable to save him.</p><p>The Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights as well as the greater social justice and climate change advocacy community are in sorrow and are in disbelief following the death of Ryan Carson.</p><p>Tragically, an act of violence that seems senseless ended both his love for Claudia Morales and his commitment to working for a better society.</p><p>While the community struggles with the sobering truth that such senseless acts of violence can strike at any moment, affecting lives irreversibly and leaving a path of pain and anguish in their wake, they stay united in their quest for justice for Ryan and Claudia as the investigation moves forward.</p><h2>Was Ryan Carson wed to Claudia, his girlfriend?</h2><p>When Ryan Carson passed so suddenly and tragically, he was not married to Claudia Morales. They were still in the middle of their passionate journey, deeply in love, and devoted to one other as boyfriend and girlfriend.</p><p>Many others were inspired and made happy by their connection. The couple, in an ironic turn of events, had attended a wedding a few hours before the fatal incident that would change their lives forever.</p><p>Social media users started to share images of the happy couple from their wedding. Ryan’s fiancée, Claudia Morales, had shared these pictures of them together, capturing their happy times together.</p><p>After her partner passed away suddenly, a tragic turn of events happened: Claudia found a letter in his phone.</p><p>This message was sent on the defunct Twitter platform, X. It says this:</p><p><strong>“Completely loving Claudia more than she has ever been loved—which is all she has ever deserved—is all I want in the end.”</strong></p><p>They didn’t have a legal marriage license, but their love for one another was evident. They shared their dreams, pleasures, and hardships, making them true life partners in every meaning of the word.</p><p>Ryan Carson’s untimely passing serves as a reminder of how fleeting life is and how important it is to cherish each minute spent with those we love.</p><p>In spite of the fact that they were not legally wed, they had an unquestionably close relationship and a lasting love.</p><p>A legacy of unwavering love and commitment, Ryan Carson’s memory and the love he had with Claudia Morales will never fade and will always inspire and affect all who knew them.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: All About Parker Posey&#39;s Dating History, Current Boyfriend & More"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1086337,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/all-about-parker-poseys-dating-history-current-boyfriend-more/"}{"1":76}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>All About Parker Posey’s Dating History, Current Boyfriend & More</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>activist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Bergie Love Island USA Autistic | Health Update 2023</a></h3>On Love Island USA Season 5, Carsten "Bergie" Bergersen won people over with his charmingly nerdy demeanor and sincere innocence.
