The following morning, one of several reporters reported seeing a bloodied aluminum baseball bat on the motorway close by, which turned out to be a murder weapon.</p><p>Investigators discovered their way to Annette Cahill through investigation. According to one of Wieneke's coworkers, she caught up with Corey on the morning of October 13 (around the time the pub was closing) and even had a disagreement with him.</p><p>But, before officials could summon Annette for questioning, she showed up at the police station and informed them that she and Wieneke were in a casual relationship.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>A 2019 jury trial found Annette Cahill responsible for the 1992 bludgeoning death of her former boyfriend Corey Lee Wieneke. <a href=#>https://t.co/m0CaRK3dXq</a></p>— WQAD (@wqad) <a href=#>March 28, 2022</a><p>She was upset that morning since they had planned to hook up, but she saw him with another female coworker, making her envious.</p><p>But she said that they subsequently reconciled and even hooked up.

She was arrested after a witness claimed she overheard Cahill confessing to killing Wieneke, a bartender, shortly after his death.</p><p>The recollection was subsequently revealed to be from an unknown lady who was nine years old at the time of Wieneke's murder. It is thought to comprise the majority of the prosecution's case.</p><p>[image-2]</p><p>Jessica Becker, now 36, allegedly told police that when she was nine, she went to play at Cahill's niece's home, in 1992.

Furthermore, the defense said that the confession was not real since it was overheard by a youngster who was not being examined by a qualified professional at the time.</p><p>According to the Muscatine Journal, a judge declared a mistrial in 2019 after a jury of five women and seven men could not find any physical evidence on her behalf.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Iowa Supreme Court has upheld the second-degree murder conviction of Annette Dee Cahill, whom a Muscatine County jury found guilty in the beating death of 22-year-old Corey Wieneke on Oct. 13, 1992. <a href=#>https://t.co/wFoEruRKQZ</a></p>— Quad-City Times (@qctimes) <a href=#>March 26, 2022</a><p>After the lawsuit was over, Cahill relocated to Tipton, remarried, and had another child and grandkids.</p><p>However, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Cinemaholic</a>, in September 2019, she was convicted guilty of second-degree murder for the second time.
