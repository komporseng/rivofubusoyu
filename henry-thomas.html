He realized he’d discovered his true calling. After that, Thomas earned a part in the 1981 Sissy Spacek film “Raggedy Man” at an open audition in a San Antonio, Texas hotel.</p><p>In the months following the release of “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” he struggled severely. At the time, he was a child actor who starred in that picture. Henry gained a lot of fame as a result of his leading and playing roles.</p><p>On <a href=# rel=nofollow>VH1’s “100 Greatest Kid Stars</a>” list, Henry Thomas was ranked #24. Then, in November 2019, Thomas Henry returned to his role as “Elliott” in a commercial for “Xfinity & Sky UK.” In this advertisement, E.T. returns for the holidays to see a now-adult Elliott and his family.</p><p>This commercial became well-known after going viral.

Furthermore, an album was in the works, but Sudden passed away abruptly in 2006, therefore the album was never released.</p><p>Thoams landed a role in the four-hour miniseries “Merlin” in 1998. When he landed at London’s Heathrow Airport, however, he was notified that his official working papers were not in order, much to his astonishment. Henry was denied entry into the nation due to an administrative blunder back home.</p><p>His attorneys later described the incident as a “unfortunate misunderstanding,” adding that her client “did not do anything criminal.” Henry Thomas was replaced by actor Paul Curran in the cast of “Merlin” when he was sacked.</p><h2>How tall is Henry Thomas?</h2><p>Thomas weighs 72 pounds and stands 5 feet 11 inches tall.
