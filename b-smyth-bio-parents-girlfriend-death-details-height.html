Also, Denzi asked for privacy during these difficult times and thanked everyone for all of their prayers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It seems Smyth’s final days were well spent. He was happily watching the dance challenges for his latest released single “Twerkaholic, Pt.2” over TikTok and IG. “He was able to have a smoother process… All the love and light you were sending on social media he really felt it and sunk into it,” Denzi explained.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, Denzi said that his brother asked him to make the video to let his fans know he “appreciates all the things you guys do for him,” and said that it was his fans that inspired him on his new projects with music or fashion.</span></p><h3><b>Did B Smyth Leave Behind A Girlfriend Or A Wife?</b></h3><p><span>B Smyth surely didn’t have a wife.

U keep me grounded and Luv me Unconditionally. #Salute to you for being the Mother & Father,” he wrote.</span></p><p><span>Guess, Smyth’s dad wasn’t in his life.</span></p><p><span>As for his siblings, Smyth has an elder brother named Denzil Smith.</span></p><p><span>Denzil was born on October 8, 1990.
